1. Perfect OCR.

Text:
Most OCR tools guess.
Prism doesn’t.
It reads handwriting, print, scans, and multilingual documents with a level of accuracy that feels unfair.
If you’re tired of fixing mistakes, you’re in the right place.

2. What Prism Sees.

Text:
Smudged forms?
Doctor handwriting?
Old PDFs?
Mixed languages?
Prism eats the chaos and gives you clean, reliable output every single time.
No special setup. No training. Just upload and watch.

3. The Three Outputs.

Text:
Prism gives you three ways to work:

Replica: A near-perfect digital rebuild of the original page.

Text: Clean, editable, human-friendly extraction.

JSON: Structured, machine-ready data for real workflows.
Choose one, or take all three at once.

4. Built for Consequences.

Text:
Legal teams. Hospitals. Banks. Insurers.
These are places where a missing line or wrong digit isn’t “annoying” — it’s expensive.
Prism is built for people who can’t afford mistakes and don’t have time to babysit their tools.

5. Show Me Proof.

Text:
No marketing claims.
Just real documents — messy, handwritten, blurred, multilingual — processed into flawless replicas, clean text, and structured JSON.
See exactly what Prism does on the documents your current OCR fails on.

6. How It Works.

Text:
Upload a document.
Prism rebuilds it from scratch.
You download the replica, the text, or the JSON.
It’s the simplest workflow you’ll adopt this year.

7. Try It Now.

Text:
Give Prism your worst document.
If it doesn’t outperform what you’re using today, you shouldn’t switch.
(But it will.)
